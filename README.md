# weatherDashboard

# User Story

As a user I would like to utilize an application that allows me to check the weather in multiple cities.

# Acceptance Criteria

I will develop an application with form inputs that allows me to search the weather for a city.

When I search for a specific city I will be presented with the current and future weather conditions.

At the time of reviewing the weather conditions the application will display the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.

When I select a city from the search history I will be presented with present and future conditions of the city.
